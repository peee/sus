    <p>
      Hello, everyone. Today, I will be discussing Salma, why Salma is sus, and why it matters.
    </p>
    Salma is sus for many reasons. Take a gander at this list:
    <br> 1. Salma's name starts with the letter "s".
    <p> Now, you may be thinking, why does this matter? </p>

  <div class="text">
    <p> The amogus population has been steadily decreasing, and they are
    currently at risk of extinction. As you know, the sus have been keen hunters of
    amogi for centuries. Professor Bennet Dover at Dabhaebay University says: </p>
    <p> "To preserve the amogus population, it would only make sense for us to control
      the numbers of sus worldwide. This means they must be captured and, perhaps,
      put down. After all, it would be a shame if the amogi were to die out." </p>
    <p> Understandably, the mention of putting down a creature may be unsettling to many.
    However, it is far more important to preserve the amogi, as we are dependent on them
    to uphold our ecosystem. Without amogi, the food chains will collapse, according to
    Prof. John Cena of the WAP (Work And Progress) Research Centre in the US. </p>
    <p> Whether or not you agree with controlling the international quantities of sus
    does not matter, because it is the objectively correct thing to do. #ejectthesus </p>
